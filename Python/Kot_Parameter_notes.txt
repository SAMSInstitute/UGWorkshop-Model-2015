The key paramters to fiddle with are:
D (dilution rate)
epsilon (amount of external forcing)
T>0 (period of external forcing)

omega is a combination of D and T when epsilon>0.
it's the angular frequency of the forcing in rescaled time.
specifically, omega = 2*pi/(T*D)

---------- Specific paramter choices to look at ----------
D = 0.15
epsilon = 0
(it doesn't matter what omega is)

This is an example of no seasonal forcing.
It yields non-zero fixed values for all variables.

----------
D = 0.1
epsilon = 0
(it doesn't matter what omega is)

This is an example of no seasonal forcing.
It yields a simple oscillation in all variables
(limit cycle).

----------
D = 0.1
epsilon = 0.1
T = 24 (or equivalently, omega = 5.0*pi/6.0)

This has seasonal forcing, but still yields a simple oscillation in all variables
(limit cycle)

----------
D = 0.1
epsilon = 0.3
T = 24 (or equivalently, omega = 5.0*pi/6.0)

Moderate seasonal forcing causes the cycle to double.
Solutions go back and forth between higher and lower amplitude cycle peaks
	in a regular, cyclical fashion.
(oscillation between two limit cycles)

----------
D = 0.1
epsilon = 0.4
T = 24 (or equivalently, omega = 5.0*pi/6.0)

More seasonal forcing causes the cycle to split a few more times.
(oscillation between six limit cycles)

----------
D = 0.1
epsilon = 0.6 or 0.8 or 1.0
T = 24 (or equivalently, omega = 5.0*pi/6.0)

Strong seasonal forcing. Pretty good looking chaotic solution.
You can get chaos for any(?) choice of epsilon >= 0.6, leaving the other parameters the same.

----------
D = 0.1
epsilon = 0.6
T = 100 (omega = 2*pi/D/T)

Two variables are a simple oscillation, the other is an oscillation with a hitch.
A limit cycle with a hitch!
epsilon 0.2-0.6:
When epsilon=0.2 you get the two-cycle effect. The smaller amplitude
oscillation decreases in amplitude as you increase epsilon. At epsilon=0.4, there's a
"hitch" in all of the variables' oscillations. The secondary cycle dies out in two of
the variables by the time you get to epsilon=0.6.

----------
D = 0.1
epsilon = 0.1
T = 100 (omega = 2*pi/D/T)

Interacting oscillatory modes in all variables. Wave envelopes!
